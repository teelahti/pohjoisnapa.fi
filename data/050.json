It could be called â€œThe Pack Ice Rallyâ€.<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>Same tactics as yesterday: We road our gear over the crushed-ice obstacle course on half-full sledges. Towards the end of the day, we were again faced with a major field of icy boulders. Nothing for it but to go up, over, or around, yet again. It was a 2-hour job.<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>There seems to be a head-cold bug going around the team. Otherwise, everyone is fit enough.<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>Today we encountered Mcnairâ€™s expedition. They are trekking with material support (i.e. receiving airdropped supplies along the way). In that respect, they can travel light. We, on the other hand, are the â€œAirborne Strangers of Finlandâ€. All of the supplies that we will need on the trek are along with us â€¦ hopefully.<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>We would like to thank everyone, in Finland and around the World, who has sent us messages of support, encouragement and questions via this Website. These greetings are most welcome! It spurs us on to know that so many people are skiing with us, â€œvirtuallyâ€. Reading your messages every evening brightens up our tent evenings no end.<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>The down side is that, at this early stage in the Expedition, we need to avoid running down the batteries of our communications gear. (We have with us solar cells for charging the batteries, but spring is still young: the sun barely rises above the horizon, for a mere 3 hours per day.) For this reason, we cannot yet reply to your messages directly from the ice pack. Later on, this may become possible, but until that time the Support Team will convey our answers to you, either directly or via these web pages.<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>All is well with the Expedition.<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>***********&nbsp; The Support Team Adds&nbsp; ************<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>We have registered all of your questions, and will be answering some of the more specific ones directly. Frequently asked questions will be answered on these web pages. This will happen in the near future, so stay tuned.<\/P>\u000d\u000a<P>If you would prefer to read these diary entries in Swedish, you will find a translation at the end of the Finnish-language diary entries, beginning with entry dated 7.
